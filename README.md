Lambda Function with OpenAI - Text Generation
Overview

This repository contains a Lambda function designed to work with OpenAI's GPT-3 model (Davinci version). The Lambda function receives a text prompt as an event, utilizes the OpenAI API to generate text based on the prompt, and returns the generated text as a response. This function can be integrated into various applications and services to generate human-like text.
Lambda Function Details

    Functionality: This Lambda function is built to generate text using OpenAI's Davinci model.
    Input: The function expects an event with a 'promp' key that contains the text prompt.
    OpenAI Model: The model used in this function is "text-davinci-003."
    API Key: To use this function, you need to provide your OpenAI API key. The key is retrieved from another Lambda function called get_api_key(), which should be set up with your API key.

How It Works

    The Lambda function receives an event with a text prompt.
    It retrieves the OpenAI API key using the get_api_key() function.
    It calls the OpenAI API to generate text based on the provided prompt.
    The generated text is extracted from the API response.
    The function returns the generated text as a JSON response.

Usage

    Clone this repository or use the Lambda function code.
    Set up an AWS Lambda function with the code provided.
    Ensure you have the required libraries installed, such as openai and boto3.
    Configure the Lambda function to trigger it with your desired events.
    Provide your OpenAI API key in the get_api_key() function.
    Deploy and test the Lambda function with appropriate text prompts.
    You will need to create a lambda layer to properly deploy it

Dependencies

    openai: Python library for OpenAI API integration.
    boto3: AWS SDK for Python used to invoke the get_api_key() function.

Acknowledgements

This Lambda function was developed to demonstrate text generation using OpenAI's GPT-3 (Davinci model). OpenAI provides powerful text generation capabilities, and this Lambda function can be integrated into various applications, chatbots, and services that require natural language generation.

Please note that this function is a basic example, and you may need to adapt it to your specific use case and security requirements.
